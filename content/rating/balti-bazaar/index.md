  J﻿osh: Meh, would have again if there was no other option.


  P﻿ete: Too sloppy, poor meat to sauce ratio, quite nice and tomatoey, but low standard meat. Surprised by their high rating on Just Eat.


  G﻿eorge: Meal wasn't as expected, not terrible but not great. A meh. Similar to the ones you get in Cornwall.
